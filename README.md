# Sales-Data-EDA
Exploring the data of an electronic store to gain insight into their products and sales.
Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

I started by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

Once I cleaned up the data a bit, I moved the data exploration section. In this section I explored 5 high level business questions related to the data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions I walked through many different pandas & matplotlib methods.
